    <h1>Number Chompers</h1>
    <section>
        <p>
            Travel back to the computer labs of yore (i.e. the late 80s & 90s) with this homage to the MECC classic Number Munchers.
            Feel yourself transported to a windowless, gray room (probably in the basement because it was cooler down there) where your assigned taupe computer awaits.
            You've finished your assignment early and you revel in the 15, nay 20 minutes remaining in which you can play an educational game for your own growth and enjoyment!
            MECC may be defunct, but its memory lives on. Please enjoy... Number Chompers.

            <p> Move your Chomper using the WASD keys and press the spacebar to chomp a number! If you need to pause, press Escape.
                Chomp all the correct answers to advance to the next level, but watch out for the baddies that want to stop you!
                Bumping into a baddie or chomping an incorrect answer will make you lose a life! But don't worry, you'll earn an extra life every 100 points.
