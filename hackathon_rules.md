## Love has infinite dimensions. Your video game will only have two.
Video games are pure artistic expression. They are equal parts code, design, communication and psychology. They're an amazing way for any aspiring developer to have fun while also building an impressive repertoire of coding skills.

This week, your challenge is to build a 2D game like Tetris, Super Mario, Civilization (warning: hard!), or similar.

## For all applications
You can build any game you'd like. Whether it's Tetris, Super Mario, Civilization, Diablo, Slime Volleyball (remember that?), or just a ball bouncing around on a screen, as long as it sticks to the following requirements:

- Your game has to be 2D. Isometric view is OK as long as there are only 2 dimensions that your character can move in.
- Your game must have a clear win condition. For example, in some games, beating the boss monster.
- Your game must have a clear lose condition. For example, in some games, losing all your lives.
- Your game's frontend must be built in JavaScript or Typescript.
- You can only use packages that you can download off NPM, and you cannot use professional game engines like Unreal, Unity or Godot. (If in doubt, ask)
- Your application must have a clear landing page. See the Hiring Hackathon Guide for more info.

## For full-stack applications
- You DON'T need authentication (sign in / sign out)
- But there must be some meaningful reason for the backend to exist. For example, tracking the player's own score or points (easy), or having a leaderboard (medium), or having multiplayer (hard).
- All of the requirements for Frontend apps apply.

## Backend
- Since this is a 2D game, there is no backend-only challenge. Instead, build a frontend or full stack app, or pair up with a frontend developer and build a full stack application.
