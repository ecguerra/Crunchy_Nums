## Challenges
### Solved Issues
- impossible levels
- Chomping 1st number of new level
- Win screen - had to be on SQUARE

### Unsolved Issues
- Better way to load level info
- Min/max for factor instead of just making set bigger
- Faster way to check for enough answers on board
- Less clunky way to play again after win or lose
- Leave the outlines when squares are chomped (undecided)
- Better scoring that doesn't clear but still allows for extra lives (and doesn't do a million)
