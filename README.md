## Demo (TBD)

## Concept
- Created for the Mintbean Aug 2021 Hackathon

### Inspirations
- The classic children's game [Number Munchers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_Munchers)!

### Installation Instructions
- None! Just a browser that can run HTML5 Canvas and Javascript

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 Canvas
- Javascript
- HTML/CSS

### Credits
- This fantastic game development tutorial by [Chris Perko](https://youtu.be/3EMxBkqC4z0) that refreshed my memory and got me started
- SFX by [Beep Yeah!](https://beepyeah.itch.io/8-bit-sfx-pack)
- Sprite drawings by me
- Social Icons by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)

## Approach

### Overview

### Wireframe

### Development Plan
- Early stage game with rectangles & no styling
- Styled game with sprites and SFX (**Current State**)
- 360-degree sprites, music, updated level, win, game over screens
- Additional types of levels

### MVP
- The user can move the Chomper around
- There are enemies in the level that move around independently 
- The enemies will make the Chomper lose a life if they touch
- The gameplay provides the player with a factor to find its multiples
- The user can chomp numbers and be told they are right or wrong
- The user can earn points and extra lives if they are right
- The user loses lives if they are wrong
- The user can pause the game
- The user can advance to the next level
- The user can win
- The user can lose
- The game is styled beyond placeholders

## Stretch Goals
- [] 360-degree sprites
- [] Background music
- [] Other level types (fractions, prime numbers, factors of a number)
- [] Animations between levels

## Challenges
### Solved Issues
- impossible levels
- Chomping 1st number of new level
- Win screen - had to be on SQUARE

### Unsolved Issues
- Better way to load level info
- Min/max for factor instead of just making set bigger
- Faster way to check for enough answers on board
- Less clunky way to play again after win or lose
- Leave the outlines when squares are chomped (undecided)
- Better scoring that doesn't clear but still allows for extra lives (and doesn't do a million)
- get game over sfx to only play once instead of on loop
